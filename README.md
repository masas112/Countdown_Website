# Countdown Website

## Overview
This TamperMonkey UserScript, named "Countdown Website," provides a countdown functionality with additional features. The script is designed to be executed on a specific Google Forms page.

## Features
1. **Start Button:** The script initiates with a "MULAI" (Start) button that, when clicked, triggers the countdown and hides the start button.
2. **Countdown Display:** A countdown element is dynamically created and displayed at the top-right corner of the page, showing the remaining time.
3. **Finish Button:** A "Selesai" (Finish) button is provided within the countdown element. Clicking it immediately ends the countdown.

## Password Protection
- **Password Form:** When the countdown reaches zero, a password form is displayed.
- **Default Password:** The default password to unlock is "asrori".
- **Customizable:** You can customize the default password by modifying the script.

## Unlocking Mechanism

2. **Correct Password:** Upon entering the correct password, the page is reloaded.

## Attribution and Customization
- **Powered By:** The script includes a "Powered By" section with a link to the GitHub profile of "MasAS." You can customize this link as needed.
